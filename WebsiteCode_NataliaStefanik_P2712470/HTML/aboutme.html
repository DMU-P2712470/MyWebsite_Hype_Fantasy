      <!-- Texts and Images. These are as simple as they get, using div classes to use in css later for editoral purposes I have made some a article style page with simple header texts (h1) and some paragraphs (p) which were really just sentences. I continued to use throughout image scr to provide visual pcitures under my texts
      as the gallery theme continued. -->

            <p>I am your average YouTuber, I am have a massive obsession over Minecraft. I know everything from the agmeplay, to modpacks, to features you can use, bugs within the game and how to create content from it. Its a game in which I have complete control over and I can create almost anything in it. The possibilities are endless!</p>

            <p>I also do alot of animation and other little additional things, mainly to build my skills and always be able to cook up something new.</p>

            <p>Recently I have started playing other games and adding them to my channel but in all honesty I have realised that I take no interest in them! Minecraft is a big goal for me and I plan to focus on THAT..</p>

            <p>But I will say, coding and researching to make this website was really fun. HOPEFULLY ill be able to make something even better in the future. Maybe? Hope you liked my thumbnails and animation screenshots. I am very proud of them.</p>

/* Banner Styling, css code is made to allow me to add more details and create a more visually interesting website. On here I have added tons of images, animations, edited text, fonts and various other things. When creating the banner, which is a simple slightly blurred image,
i made sure the body had the margin and the padding reset to 0. This meant there was no problems later where certain items were located differently and later on would mess up the phone dimension view of the website. The header had the image url added. The background-repaeat: no repeat was
simply added to prevent the image from duplicating itself to fill the space it couldnt fill with one image. (this means the image just stretches itself. (it didnt bother me though as i just needed a simple background that was not a solid color. the rest was to adjust the location and size
of the image using align items and justify content. */

 /* Animated Images With Links, this is the code in reference to the images I often place around the page that are connected with links to the urls. It has a border behind the image that I keep hidden as later on i found that the border is a little pointless. As I am finishing explaining my code I have found that i
 shoudl have judt made it completely transparent rather than adjust the images to the borders. But they have the hover option so the images stay above the borders and makes the 3 second animation easier to add later. */
